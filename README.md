# Project Description: 
## 1.1 Objectives:
The objective of the project is to apply the different classification and clustering algorithms to the 
problem of classifying cyber-attacks in network traffic. This will help your retention of the material 
and significantly enhance the depth of your understanding. This will also develop your skills in 
reporting the performance. We encourage you to work in a group of (maximum) two students.
## 1.2 Dataset Description:
The dataset is available in the project folder. It comprises of two text files, the “Dataset.txt” file
contains the complete dataset. Each column specifies the attributes of network traffic, out of which 
some or all may be considered as features for classification. The other file “Attack_types.txt”
summarizes the possible attack types.
National University of Computer & 
Emerging Sciences Peshawar Campus
## 1.3 Scope of Work 
For the given dataset, we want to develop classifiers for the prediction of attack type, given their 
attributes.
The scope of the project includes 
• Formulation of the problem under consideration. 
• Cleaning and pre-processing the data. 
• Apply feature engineering (if needed). 
• Implement the classification and clustering algorithm. (Details below)
• Report the performance of the algorithms and presentation of analysis/findings
